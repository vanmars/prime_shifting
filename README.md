# _Prime Sifting_

_24 September 2020_

#### _Application that lists all the prime numbers up to a given number_

#### By _**Vanessa Stewart and Drew Parker**_

## Description

_This is a project for Epicodus to practice working with Ruby classes and test driven development. The original instructions include:_

Given a number, write a method that returns all of the prime numbers less than that number.

This is a tricky problem and you should use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to solve it. Here's how the Sieve of Eratosthenes works to find a number up to a given number:

Create a list of numbers from 2 through n: 2, 3, 4, ..., number.
Initially, let prime equal 2, the first prime number.
Starting from prime, remove all multiples of prime from the list.
Increment prime by 1.
When you reach number, all the remaining numbers in the list are primes.

## Specifications
| Spec     | Behavior | Input    | Output   |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | Program returns an array of every number between 2 and user input | 12 | 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 |
| 2 | Program returns an array with multiples of 2 removed | 12 | 2,3,5,6,7,9,11 |
| 3 | Program returns an array with multiples of 3 removed | 12 | 2,3,5,7,11 |
| 4 | Program returns an array with multiples of 5 removed | 12 | 2,3,5,7,11 |
| 5 | Program returns an array with multiples of 7 removed | 12 | 2,3,5,7,11 |
| 6 | Program returns an array with multiples of 11 removed | 12 | 2,3,5,7,11 |
